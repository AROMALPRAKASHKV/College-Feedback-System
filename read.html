           Vimal Jyothi Engineering College (VJEC) is an educational project of the Archdiocese of Thallassery established in the year 2002 and is managed by Meshar Diocesan Educational Trust. The college is approved by AICTE and affiliated to APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University ( KTU). VJEC is a self-financing catholic minority institution aiming at generating a fervor for Engineering and Technology in students. Here we inspire, nurture and foster them to realize their career potential in the field of Engineering and Technology.

            With profound insight into the resource requirements of the higher education system, VJEC has proudly set up world-class infrastructure complemented with intellectual capital in the form of competent faculty. Many of the facilities are way beyond the regulatory requirements aiming for learning beyond the syllabus to address the requirements of the industry. These material facilities along with value addition programs and student support systems are the integral facets of empowerment at VJEC.
            
            Digital library, industry supported project labs, language lab, and student chapters of professional bodies such as IEEE, ISOI, IETE, SAE, CSI offer an extensive range of resources, opportunities and services to the outcome based teaching learning process. Effective implementation of quality control processes ensure Engineering graduates with the expected level of knowledge, skill and attitude..</p>
